Hello Tesselators, we’re happy to present to you our first installment of This Week in Tessel. Here we will highlight the latest news, projects, and events, from code, to community, to hardware manufacturing.

### Developing Tessel 2

**Moving towards Manufacturing** There is now an approximate timeline for manufacturing and shipping Tessel 2:

1. *Week of 5/25* — Fifteen prototype boards are sent back from the manufacturer (bringing the total number of Tessel 2’s up to 22!) These will undergo final testing before starting production.

2. *Week of 6/8* — Finalize test rigs and procedures.

3. *Week of 6/15* — Begin final production in China.

4. *Late July / Early August* — Expected shipments and general sale of Tessel 2.

Developments from the engineering side:

* A specification for Tessel’s command-line tools was opened up for community review and is [ready for implementation](https://github.com/tessel/t2-cli/issues)

* Tessel 2 will be tested by our manufacturer using a custom test rig. The [schematics for these test rigs are online](https://github.com/tessel/t2-hw-test-rig) and are now moving to board layout.

### Projects

**New hardware module** Community member [@nmoadev](https://github.com/nmoadev) created a [Tessel module for Adafruit’s backlit keypad](https://tessel.io/modules#trellis) as part of an Embedded Systems final project.

### Community Updates

**JavaScript and Hardware** [Tomomi Imura](https://twitter.com/girlie_mac) chronicles the dive from pure code to hardware, including Tessel, LittleBits, Arduino, Johnny-Five, and Raspberry Pi in [Hardware Hacking for JavaScript Peeps: How I Got My Hands on Breadboards and Resistors](http://www.girliemac.com/blog/2015/05/04/hardware-hacking-for-javascript-developers/)

**Tessel Worldwide** This week, #SMARTuniverCITY in Barcelona learned about [gathering data from sensors on Tessel](https://twitter.com/alexmuntada/status/595863540474454016). Students from Singapore [experimented with Tessel](https://twitter.com/CrispianTanTS/status/595059625218543616) at an SAP HANA Codejam.

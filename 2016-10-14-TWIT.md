# This Week in Tessel: Hacktoberfest, Rust update, and conferences, oh my!

Hello, Tesselators!

**TL;DR:**
* [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com) is back, and we have [open issues](https://github.com/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AHacktoberFest+user%3Atessel+) labeled for participants!
* We just released an update to [t2-cli](https://github.com/tessel/t2-cli/releases/tag/v0.1.0), enabling local compilation for Rust programs!
* Jon and Kelsey will be at [JSConf Asia](https://2016.jsconf.asia) in November to speak and host a [hands-on Tessel module workshop](http://www.eventnook.com/event/devfestasiaevents2016/home)!

## Hacktoberfest

DigitalOcean brought [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com) back to life this month to encourage more open source contributions by sharing resources for [creating more approachable issues](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/charlotte-spencer/2015-september-16) and giving out shirts & stickers to participants. As part of our goals this year to increase contributions and encourage both inclusion and accessibility to newcomers, we've labeled [a bunch of issues](https://github.com/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AHacktoberFest+user%3Atessel+) for folks who want to get started!

## Local Rust Compilation

As the Rust APIs for Tessel are in the process of being build ([check out the repo](https://github.com/tessel/tessel-rust)), Tim Ryan ([@trimryan](https://twitter.com/trimryan)) has added support for local compilation for those Rust programs in the latest release of [t2-cli](https://github.com/tessel/t2-cli/releases/tag/v0.1.0). Try it out and let us know how it's working for you in the #rust-lang channel of our [Slack team](https://tessel-slack.herokuapp.com/).

## Jon and Kelsey at JSConf Asia

[Jon McKay](https://twitter.com/jonmckay) and [Kelsey Breseman](https://twitter.com/SelkeyMoonbeam) will be at [JSConf Asia](https://2016.jsconf.asia) at the end of November to speak and [host a workshop](http://www.eventnook.com/event/devfestasiaevents2016/home), where you can learn about hardware communication patterns and building a custom Tessel module. There is still plenty of time to grab a ticket and join them for a full 10 days of tech events!

Cool stuff in the community:
* [Rahul Ravikumar wrote about the crash reporter in t2-cli](https://tessel.io/blog/150147968652/the-tessel-crash-reporter-service)
* [The ESP32 chip was released last month and looks very promising as the potential brains in the Tessel Reach](http://hackaday.com/2016/09/15/esp32-hands-on-awesome-promise/)
* [Helen Holmes has started a newsletter called This Week in Hardware, showcasing awesome hardware projects and getting started experiences.](http://tinyletter.com/thisweekinhardware/archive)

That's all for this week! Feel free to submit to [the next newsletter](https://github.com/tessel/this-week-in-tessel/issues/48). In the meantime, see you online.

With love,<br/>
Everyone at the Tessel Project

### Developing Tessel 2

**Manufacturing Update** We’re eagerly anticipating a shipment from our manufacturer of fifteen prototype boards, expected in the next two weeks. This marks the fourth revision of Tessel 2 and the expected final design before full manufacturing.

**Developing for Tessel without Tessel** The process for developing for Tessel 2 today is getting easier. Last week Jon McKay wrote a post on [contributing to Tessel 2 without hardware](https://tessel.io/blog/118385488827/contributing-to-tessel-2-without-hardware). To make this process even easier, we are [designing a command line tool to simply <nobr>`t2-vm run`</nobr>](https://github.com/tessel/t2-vm/pull/5) so you can get started with Tessel in just two lines.

**Rust Support** How will the familiar Tessel experience be used to program in Rust? <nobr>`t2 init --lang rust <project_name>`</nobr> now [creates a new Cargo project](https://github.com/tessel/t2-cli/tree/kn-rust)! Currently [the process for targeting Rust code](https://github.com/tessel/rust-tessel) for a Tessel 2 is messy, but we’re working on [cross-compiling the Rust standard library](https://gist.github.com/kevinmehall/16e8b3ea7266b048369d) without needing additional tools. More Rust examples will be demoed in the upcoming weeks.

**Test Rig** Eric Kolker spent time playing mechanical engineer this week. A blog post about Tessel’s entire testing process will come later, but here are some pretty renders of the [publicly available test rig](https://github.com/tessel/t2-hw-test-rig#mechanical-model).

### Projects

**Tessel-powered cereal dispenser** As part of [Fullstack Academy’s](http://www.fullstackacademy.com/) Tessel hack day, student [Carlos Mendoza](https://twitter.com/carlosrmendoza/status/596793165740384258) created an automatic cereal dispenser (or kibble dispenser?) that dispenses food at the behest of a webapp.

### Community Updates

**Tessel Worldwide** Matteo Collina [held a Tessel Workshop](https://twitter.com/afelicioni_pro/status/598418796395765760) as part of JSDay in Verona, Italy. Plenty of [hardware](https://twitter.com/jsconfit/status/598411123604480001), plenty of [cool hacks](https://twitter.com/stefanodipede/status/598473447619067904)! Tessel was also spotted around the US at Fullstack Bootcamp in NYC as part of a [Tessel Hack Day](https://twitter.com/fullstack/status/596741460378124288), a[presentation at OpenWest Conf](https://twitter.com/jcmneal/status/596774836170457088) in Utah by Kevin Sidwar, and [at IoT World](https://instagram.com/p/2l3thopmXF/?taken-by=technicalhumans) in San Francisco.

This Week in Tessel is sent out every Wednesday! In the next week we’ll have some exciting news for the Tessel project. Talk to you soon. — The Tessel Team

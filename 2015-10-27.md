Hi Tesselators!

It's been a few weeks since the last This Week in Tessel, our apologies! We've been hard at work on the Tessel repos, building and growing the project.

### Get excited

We've already built most of our Tessel Start experience for the Tessel 2 - [give yourself a tour](tessel.io/t2-start)! We've also released a set of preliminary Tessel 2 docs to [tessel.io/docs](https://tessel.io/docs/home).

### Get involved

We're also excited to have finished open sourcing literally all of our repos, including (at long last) our website, [tessel.io](https://github.com/tessel/tessel.io). Now, if you find something broken there you can file an issue or PR instead of reporting over Twitter.

Interested in helping build Tessel 2? Two links for you:

1. [Tessel's Slack](https://tessel-slack.herokuapp.com/) so you can ask us questions and get help getting started
2. [The "Hardware Not Required" tag on our T2-CLI repo](https://github.com/tessel/t2-cli/labels/Hardware%20Not%20Required) where you can build functionality and get familiar with Tessel before your Tessel 2 ships

### Welcome to the team

Just taking a quick moment to call attention to all the people who have joined our growing volunteer contributor [team](https://github.com/tessel/project/blob/master/TEAM.md). We're happy to have you!

Hi Tesselators!

It's been a few weeks since the last This Week in Tessel â€“ time for an update! We've been hard at work on the Tessel repos, building and growing the project.

### Shipping Timeline
As many of you know, FCC testing has been a challenge for us, particularly reconclining our local hardware test setups with those of our FCC testing counterparts overseas (does "it worked on my computer" sound familiar? Even worse with hardware and a language barrier). But we have an end in sight! Seeed Studio expects us to have results from FCC testing back by Friday, November 27th.

Once FCC certification is passed, sourcing the components will take up to 6 weeks. We expect at that point to start producing in batches of 500/week. As of now, we expect the first shipments out in mid-January.

Please get in touch if the new date is an issue for you, and we'll see what we can do: support@tessel.io.

### Get excited

We've already built most of the Tessel Start experience for the Tessel 2 - [give yourself a tour](//tessel.io/t2-start)! We've also released a set of preliminary Tessel 2 docs to [tessel.io/docs](https://tessel.io/docs/home).

We're also excited to have finished open sourcing literally all of our repos, including (at long last) our website, [tessel.io](https://github.com/tessel/tessel.io). Now, if you find something broken there, please submit an issue on Github, or better yet, send a pull request!

### Get involved

Interested in helping build Tessel 2? We have two links for wonderful contributors like you:

1. [Tessel's Slack](https://tessel-slack.herokuapp.com/) so you can ask us questions and get help getting started
2. [The "Hardware Not Required" tag on our T2-CLI repo](https://github.com/tessel/t2-cli/labels/Hardware%20Not%20Required) where you can build functionality and get familiar with Tessel before your Tessel 2 ships

### Welcome to the team

Just taking a quick moment to call attention to all the people who have joined our growing volunteer contributor [team](https://github.com/tessel/project/blob/master/TEAM.md). We're happy to have you!

# Ramping up Rust, Backing away from Python, Johnny Five Inventor's Kit, Tessel Talks

Hello, Tesselators!

**TL;DR:**
* We've been working on better **Rust** support, and would love for you to join us in the #rust-lang channel of the [Tessel Slack](//tessel-slack.herokuapp.com).
* We are removing **Python** from first-class support due to lack of interest.
* Tessel 2 is in **Sparkfun**, where it can be purchased by itself or in the very exciting new [Johnny Five Inventor's Kit](https://www.sparkfun.com/j5ik), which includes great breadboardable tutorials.
* There have been some great **conference talks** on Tessel lately, especially [this retrospective on the design lessons for embedded Node through Tessels 1 and 2](https://opbeat.com/events/web-rebels-2016/#the-eternal-struggle-node-js-in-embedded-devices).
* You can get more regular **updates** either by [helping to write this newsletter](https://github.com/tessel/this-week-in-tessel), or by reading our [meeting notes](https://github.com/tessel/project/tree/master/meetings) (or both!).

## Multiple language support

### Ramping up Rust
We've long been intrigued by the [Rust Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/), and have lately been pushing forward for a more native Rust support experience, including easy deploy from the `t2` command line tool.

We will have a beta version of Rust support available in the next CLI release. We're using a remote cross-compilation server to build Rust projects for Tessel (so you don't even need Rust installed on your computer) but plan to switch to defaulting to [`rustup`](http://blog.rust-lang.org/2016/05/13/rustup.html) in the near future so Rustaceans can easily cross-compile locally.

Currently, support is limited to blinking LEDs on Tessel 2, but our next step is to build out support for all the Tessel 2 hardware with the [tessel-rust](https://github.com/tessel/tessel-rust) repository. We'll also need to port all of our module libraries from JavaScript to Rust; this could be an excellent way to learn more about Rust, so please get in touch in the #rust-lang channel of [Tessel Slack](//tessel-slack.herokuapp.com) if you're interested in contributing or reviewing code!

### Backing away from Python
Ever since our announcement of Python on Tessel 2 last year, we've been waiting eagerly for a crowd of Pythonistas to charge in and excitedly exclaim, "I want that! I want to make that happen!"

However, we haven't seen it. The basic pathway for Python on Tessel 2 has been proven out, but we haven't heard from anyone who's interested in taking on full support - or even much interest for using it. So we're letting it go. You'll see it disappear from the homepage soon. We can always pick up [from here](https://github.com/tessel/tessel-python) if the enthusiasm arrives.

## Introducing the Johnny Five Inventor's Kit
We're very excited to announce that a collaboration with Bocoup and Sparkfun has recently come to fruition in the form of the [Johnny Five Inventor's Kit](https://www.sparkfun.com/j5ik).

The Tessel 2-based kit focuses on electronics learning, with breadboards and standard electronic components rather than modules. If you've ever been interested in prototyping beyond Tessel modules, the detailed and beginner-friendly new [experiment guide](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/experiment-guide-for-the-johnny-five-inventors-kit/?_ga=1.220196633.1460354922.1460705643) will walk you through it.

## Talks and projects from the community
Recent Tessel talks:
* [The Eternal Struggle: Node.JS in Embedded Devices:](https://opbeat.com/events/web-rebels-2016/#the-eternal-struggle-node-js-in-embedded-devices) by Jon McKay, a retrospective on the Tessel project's attempts to run Node on embedded devices and the lessons they learned along the way
* [Live Coding Tessel 2: Hello World to Web-controlled Device in 20 Minutes](https://opbeat.com/events/nodeconf-oslo-2016/#live-coding-tessel-2-hello-world-to-web-controlled-device-in-20-minutes) by Kelsey Breseman, demonstrating how to turn Tessel and sensors into a couple of useful devices within a few lines of code
* [That Escalated Quickly! Prototyping IoT with JavaScript](https://opbeat.com/events/nodeconf-oslo-2016/#that-escalated-quickly-prototyping-iot-with-javascript) by Eirik Morland, a creative exploration of how hardware + Node lets you quickly connect data gathering equipment to computer-generated music libraries to let your homebrewed beers compose requiems, and more

In time for the 4th of July, try making your own any-color VR fireworks with [this Tessel 2 + Oculus project](https://www.hackster.io/RONDAGDAG/virtual-reality-fireworks-using-color-sensor-779ea7) by Ron Dagdag.

See Tesselators at events around the world:
* Kelsey and Flaki are speakers at [RuhrJS](//ruhrjs.de) in Bochum, Germany on July 2-3.
* Jon and Kelsey will give a Tessel 2 hackathon with prizes at [Fullstack](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/7278-fullstack-2016-the-conference-on-javascript-node-and-internet-of-things) in London on July DATES
* Keep an eye out for more speaking announcements soon!

## Development updates
* On Tessel's command line, [the latest releases](https://github.com/tessel/t2-cli/releases) include some patching and corrections, improvements to the crash reporter tool which helps us identify and debug issues, and some background work for multiple language support.
* In the firmware, [recent releases](https://github.com/tessel/t2-firmware/releases) have improved Windows USB driver support and added a few features to GPIO use of the module ports.

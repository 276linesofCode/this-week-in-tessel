# This Week in Tessel: Thanks for all the PRs

Hello, Tesselators!

**TL;DR:**
* Help out on the [redesign of tessel.io](https://github.com/tessel/tessel.io/issues/102)
* Thank you to our [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com) participants!
* [SparkFun Tutorials](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/tags/johnny-five) with the Tessel 2

## tessel.io is ready for a redesign

The original design of tessel.io was focused on promoting and pre-ordering the Tessel 2, showing off its many features, modules, and example code. Now the Tessel 2 is out in the real world, available at [SparkFun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13841?ref=tessel.io), [Seeed Studio](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Tessel-2-p-2622.html?ref=tessel.io), and even [Micro Center](http://www.microcenter.com/product/468600/Tessel_2_Development_Board), so its time for tessel.io to focus on the Tessel Project and the incredible community around it. If you want to help design and build front page of an open-source hardware and software platform, check out the [open issue](https://github.com/tessel/tessel.io/issues/102) and let us know how you want to get involved!

## Hacktoberfest Review

[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com) was a rousing success yet again for the open-source community on GitHub. Thank you to the new and current contributors who participated because we appreciate every PR opened. There are still plenty of [starter issues](https://github.com/issues?utf8=âœ“&q=is%3Aissue+user%3Atessel+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22contribution-starter%22) available for anyone who wants to get some practice in for next year's event.

## Build cool stuff with SparkFun and Tessel 2

Our friends at [SparkFun](https://www.sparkfun.com) and [Bocoup](https://bocoup.com) put together some [amazing project tutorials](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/tags/johnny-five) using parts from the [Johnny-Five Inventor's Kit](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13847), along with a few other materials. These projects are great for anyone who wants to move past the hardware basics and construct a full-featured machine or Internet-connected service with Tessel 2. If you haven't bought the Inventor's Kit yet, it will be a part of [SparkFun's Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals](https://www.sparkfun.com/news/2236)!

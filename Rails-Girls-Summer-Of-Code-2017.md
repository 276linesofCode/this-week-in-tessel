# Team 276linesofCode - Rails Girls Summer of Code 2017

Hey all,

It has been a long long ride since February and its finally July!
This is when we start our Rails Girls Summer of Code (RGSoC) 2017 program, by working and contributing for Tessel. Having seen Tessel as a project in the RGSoC project list of 2017, we were eager to take it up at once since, we felt that through this project we would be able to discover both the horizons - Hardware and Software.


### Who are we?

Team 276linesofCode is an amalgamation of all things tech and electronic. The Team comprises of Shravika Mittal and Brihi Joshi, a duo from New Delhi, India, in their sophomore year of College at IIIT Delhi. We are a dynamic duo that believes in learning and strengthening concepts while on the way to developing something.

Shravika is an Undergraduate majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. Its been hardly a year since she's got her hands dirty with programming, and it's already a vital part of her daily schedule. She brings out dedication and hard work in the team, excelling in whatever she does. Brihi is majoring in Electronics and Communication Engineering and loves to mix and fiddle with creativity in code. She brings in the caffeine induced late night coding sessions along with fresh experiments in the team.


### What is RGSoC?

Rails Girls Summer of Code is an award-winning global fellowship program aimed at bringing more diversity into Open Source.

It is about helping newcomers to the world of programming further expand their knowledge and skills, by contributing to a worthwhile Open Source project. The focus is not on producing highly sophisticated code, but rather participants learning transferable skills from their project work. Apart from inducing coding skills in real world projects, the RGSoC inculcates community building, by introducing its scholars to the mentors who are in control of the actual projects.

This year, 20 teams were selected among which, 16 are Sponsored teams (We are one of them :smile:) and 4 are Volunteer teams.

You may have a look at their [website](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/).

## What are we here for?

First and most important of all, __to have fun!__ We are way too excited to start contributing and giving our best to this community.
We are kicking off with an implementation of the 1-wire protocol in Tessel, which requires a lot of reading and working from our end. 

Then we are looking forward to move to a real world project, which can be solved using Tessel.

Before the beginning of RGSoC 17, we had formulated a plan to work on a project called Humanoid Arm Project ([HAP](https://techiiit.wordpress.com)). We would like to continue our work on this and bring it into realisation for solving some day to day problems using technology.

Having experienced a few IoT developmemt boards before, we cannot wait to delve deeper into the various functionalities and modules that Tessel has got to offer us. Also, Rust an JavaScript is a new experience for us. This would be the first time both of us are contributing to an Open Source project and we would like to learn the most we can from it.

Lastly, we really hope RGSoC would help us transitioning from Team 276linesofCode to _Tesselators_ so that we can contribute to it and be a part of this community even after RGSoC is over.

Here's to an exciting summer! :tada: :confetti_ball:

# This Week in Tessel: Subject line mentioning a few things in the newsletter

Hello, Tesselators!

**TL;DR:**
* One sentence about the first heading with **keywords** in bold
* One sentence about the **next** heading with.. etc.
* etc.

## The most important thing we're working on!

Decide what's first and write about it here, briefly but with any needed detail or links

## Something else, like what has happened in the latest releases

Good to see some development happening

## Anything else, like some links to projects or blog posts

Like this:
* [Here's a video of something cool somebody made]()
* [Somebody talked about this other thing]()

That's all for this week! Feel free to submit to [the next newsletter](collector issue for the next one). In the meantime, see you online.

With love,<br/>
Everyone at the Tessel Project

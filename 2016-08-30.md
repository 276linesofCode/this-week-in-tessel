# This Week in Tessel: the busy summer issue!

Hello, Tesselators!

**TL;DR:**
* [Tesselcamp](https://github.com/tessel/project/issues/179) is coming up this week in NYC!
* [International Nodebots Day](http://nodebots.io/#nodebots-day) was a grand success with the [Johnny-Five Inventor's Kit](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/1384://www.sparkfun.com/products/13847)!
* We want your feedback on an upcoming Tessel project -> [Tessel Community Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScBWewWewrpcfLEw7ogQB9MB3e79kAZdcOwg2FQTci1XGBOTg/viewform)

## Tesselcamp

Tesselcamp is this week on September 1st through 3rd in NYC. We're ready to provide time & space dedicated for people to contribute to the Tessel Project. September 1st & 2nd will be community contribution days located at [61 Local](http://61local.com/) with lunch provided. We want to collaborate with existing team members and welcome new contributors to continue making Tessel one of the most inclusive and approachable open-source hardware communities. On September 3rd, the Tessel Steering Committee will be meeting *in person* for the first time in forever to discuss **SOMETHING??**. 

We hope you're able to join us. If not, we hope to do more events like this and help organize meetups in your local community. (**<-- needs work?**)

## Nodebots Day Recap

We mentioned [International Nodebots Day](http://nodebots.io/#nodebots-day) in the last newsletter, with a special mention of the [Johnny-Five Inventor's Kit](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/1384://www.sparkfun.com/products/13847) as the kit of choice for a few of the event locations, like [NYC](https://twitter.com/nodebots_nyc/status/759420544127303681) and [Miami](https://twitter.com/MiamiJS/status/75944265966031257://twitter.com/MiamiJS/status/759442659660312576). The Tessel 2 was also used to power Sumobots at Houston's event, with a [great recap](http://justingosses.com/nodebots/) by Justin Gosses.

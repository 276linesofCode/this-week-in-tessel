# This Week in Tessel: Fun with Open Source

Hi, Tesselators!

Engineering work feels good. You work concretely toward a solution. You learn while you work. When you fix a bug or add a feature, you get a surge of accomplishment.

Looking for something to sink your teeth into? In this issue of This Week in Tessel, we'll give you suggestions for a few tasks to tackle.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here are some open Tessel issues you can dive into. Feel free to jump in and ask questions, even if it's something new for you!

## What's something I can finish in an evening?

- [Make it easier for the CLI to find your Tessel even in a room full of Tessels](https://github.com/tessel/t2-cli/issues/743)
- [Make module hardware information easier to find in docs](https://github.com/tessel/t2-docs/issues/145)
- [Document `pin.pull`](https://github.com/tessel/t2-docs/issues/93)

## How do I claim an issue?

If you see an issue you'd like to work on, comment that you're working on it and ask for any information you need.

Comment on the issue with any progress or problems– if you've tried something, even if you don't resolve the issue, it might be useful for someone else who comes along later.

**Join us on [Slack](tessel-slack.herokuapp.com) while you work so we can support you!**

## Other stuff we're up to

- Want reimbursement for materials you need to work on Tessel? Conversely, want to financially support our work? Check out Tessel's **new [Open Collective page](https://opencollective.com/tessel)**
- We're one of the projects for RailsGirls 2017 Summer of Code! RailsGirls is an inclusive code mentoring organization, which (despite the name) does more than just Rails. We are excited to be a part of this– [**applications are open**](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/blog/2017-02-01-ready-set-apply) if you or someone you know wants to spend three months working on open source.

# This Week in Tessel: Fun with Open Source

Hi, Tesselators!

Engineering work feels good: you get a defined problem, you work concretely toward a solution, and you get that surge of accomplishment when you fix a bug or add a feature.

Looking for something to sink your teeth into as we hit the long-drawn-out part of winter? In this issue of This Week in Tessel, we'll give you suggestions for a few tasks to tackle.

## What's something I can finish in an evening?

## What's something that will let me work with peers I can learn from?

## What's the hardest thing you've got?

**Join us on [Slack](tessel-slack.herokuapp.com) while you work so we can support you!**

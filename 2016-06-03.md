# SUBJECT

## Multiple language support

### Ramping up Rust
* Rust contrib?

### Backing away from Python
Ever since our announcement of Python on Tessel 2 last year, we've been waiting eagerly for a crowd of Pythonistas to charge in and excitedly exclaim, "I want that! I want to make that happen!"

However, we haven't seen it. The basic pathway for Python on Tessel 2 has been proven out, but we haven't heard from anyone who's interested in taking on full support - or even much interest for using it. So we're letting it go. You'll see it disappear from the homepage soon. We can always pick up [from here](https://github.com/tessel/tessel-python) if the enthusiasm arrives.

# Improving Rust, Letting Go of Python, Open Finances, and More

## Multiple language support

### Ramping up Rust
We've long been intrigued by the Rust Language, and have lately been pushing forward for a more native Rust support experience, including easy deploy from the `t2` command line tool.

You can see the state of the project at the [tessel-rust](https://github.com/tessel/tessel-rust) repo. If you're testing it out, please let us know what you think! Issues, PRs, and conversation in the #rust-lang channel of the [Tessel Slack](//tessel-slack.herokuapp.com) are all welcome.

### Backing away from Python
Ever since our announcement of Python on Tessel 2 last year, we've been waiting eagerly for a crowd of Pythonistas to charge in and excitedly exclaim, "I want that! I want to make that happen!"

However, we haven't seen it. The basic pathway for Python on Tessel 2 has been proven out, but we haven't heard from anyone who's interested in taking on full support - or even much interest for using it. So we're letting it go. You'll see it disappear from the homepage soon. We can always pick up [from here](https://github.com/tessel/tessel-python) if the enthusiasm arrives.

## Sponsor Tessel's development on Open Collective
In pursuit of better financial transparency, we've just joined Open Collective: a way for us to raise funds for development and visibly disburse them to contributors. Check out the [Tessel Open Collective page](https://opencollective.com/tessel)!

See more about the Tessel Project's finances [here](https://github.com/tessel/project/blob/master/FINANCES.md).

## Development updates
* On Tessel's command line, [the latest releases](https://github.com/tessel/t2-cli/releases) include some patching and corrections, improvements to the crash reporter tool which helps us identify and debug issues, and some background work for multiple language support.
* In the firmware, [recent releases](https://github.com/tessel/t2-firmware/releases) have improved Windows USB driver support and added a few features to GPIO use of the module ports.

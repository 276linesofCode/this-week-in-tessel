# This Week in Tessel: The start of something new (?)

Hello, Tesselators!

**TL;DR:**
* Help out on the redesign of tessel.io
* Thank you to our Hacktoberfest participants!

## tessel.io is ready for a redesign

TODO: Decide what's first and write about it here, briefly but with any needed detail or links

## Hacktoberfest Review

TODO: Good to see some development happening

## Anything else, like some links to projects or blog posts

Like this:
* [Tim Ryan spoke at Rustfest in Berlin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoKPupeKW08)
* [Somebody talked about this other thing]()

That's all for this week! Feel free to submit to [the next newsletter](https://github.com/tessel/this-week-in-tessel/issues/50). In the meantime, see you online.

With love,<br/>
Everyone at the Tessel Project

*This Week in Tessel is where we highlight the latest news, projects, and events, from code, to community, to hardware manufacturing.*

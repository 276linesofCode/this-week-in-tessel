We are thrilled to announce that Tessel 2 has shipped to all domestic and international pre-orders.

To our knowledge, this is the first time a distributed, unpaid team of open source contributors has shipped a physical product. This is a major milestone in the open source hardware movement.

Huge thanks to everyone who has contributed so far to the Tessel Project. Whether you're a core contributor, someone who found a typo to fix, or one of our test subjects for the start experience: thank you. We value what you've done.

### "This sounds like a cool project, how can I get involved?"

New contributors are always welcome! Here are a few ways to get involved:

* Read through the [Tessel 2 Technical Overview](https://github.com/tessel/onboarding/blob/master/T2-TECHNICAL-OVERVIEW.md) to get an idea of T2's tech stack, then pick a repo that looks interesting to you. There are plenty of open issues to choose from - [including these ones tagged specially for newbies](https://github.com/tessel/t2-cli/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Acontribution-easy).
* Go to the [Tessel forums](https://tessel.io/forums) and help someone solve their problem. Whether it's a bug on our end or theirs, you will probably learn something.
* Join us on the [Tessel Slack](https://tessel-slack.herokuapp.com/) and ask about contributing to the project - we'll talk to you!

You can read more about how the Tessel Project works as an organization under open governance on the [Tessel Project repo](https://github.com/tessel/project).

### "I just got my Tessel 2, what do I do?"

The best place to start with your Tessel 2 is at [tessel.io/start](//tessel.io/start). You can find tutorials there for everything from blinking lights to tweeting to creating your own local internet.

If you're interested in trying something off the beaten path - electrical fun, advanced hacks, and more, check out [tessel.io/docs](//tessel.io/docs). If you're new to hardware, don't worry! They're intended to be accessible to electrical newbies - and if they're not, please [file an issue](https://github.com/tessel/t2-docs/issues) to let us know.

We're continuing to update the start experience and the Tessel 2 docs, so please check back again!

*"But wait, I don't think mine shipped!" - if this is you, please contact support@tessel.io, and we will figure it out. Please do note that orders from Seeed Studio's page are fulfilled by Seeed directly.*

### "What's next for the Tessel Project?"

Phew, shipping one product was a lot of work! Realistically, there will be some bugfixing to do as all of you let us know how it's going and what you're working on.

As far as a next product- no promises, but [we have some ideas...](https://github.com/tessel/project/issues/142).

Partially, it's up to you: what do you want to see? What's the best way we can further the [Tessel Project Mission](https://github.com/tessel/project/blob/master/MISSION.md)?

Much love,

[The Tessel Project team](https://github.com/tessel/project/blob/master/TEAM.md)
